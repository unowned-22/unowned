# Local Development Environment

This repository contains the local development infrastructure for the project.

The environment includes:

* Caddy (reverse proxy)
* PostgreSQL
* RabbitMQ
* MinIO
* Mailpit
* Adminer
* Redis

Application repositories are cloned automatically into the `workspace` directory using the provided Makefile.

## Requirements

* Docker
* Docker Compose
* Git
* GNU Make

## Project Structure

```text
localenv/
├── docker-compose.yml
├── Caddyfile
├── Makefile

└── workspace/
    ├── api/
    └── unowned/
```

## Initial Setup

Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd unowned
```

Clone all project repositories and start the environment:

```bash
make init
```

This command will:

1. Create the `workspace` directory.
2. Clone all configured repositories.
3. Start all Docker services.

## Available Commands

### Clone repositories

```bash
make clone
```

### Update repositories

```bash
make pull
```

### Start infrastructure

```bash
make up
```

### Stop infrastructure

```bash
make down
```

### Restart infrastructure

```bash
make restart
```

### View logs

```bash
make logs
```

### Check container status

```bash
make status
```

### Remove containers and volumes

```bash
make clean
```

## Hosts Configuration

Stories feature (backend + frontend)
-----------------------------------

This repository contains an in-progress Stories feature (ephemeral user stories similar to social apps).

- Server-side: stories are stored one row per user in the `stories` table; uploads for story media are placed into a private MinIO bucket and only object keys are persisted. The API returns short-lived presigned GET URLs for serving private media.
- Endpoints added: `POST /api/v1/stories` (publish/append), `GET /api/v1/stories/me`, `GET /api/v1/stories/feed`, `POST /api/v1/stories/{id}/view`, `POST /api/v1/stories/media` and helpers for likes/replies.
- Current visibility decision: the `friends` and `close` visibility options are not implemented yet — they are currently treated as `everyone` in the feed. Implementing a social graph (follows/friends/close-friends) is planned as a follow-up and is intentionally skipped for now to unblock delivery of core features.

See `workspace/api/AGENTS.md` and `workspace/panel/AGENTS.md` for developer notes about the implementation and next steps.
